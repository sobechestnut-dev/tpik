---

üß Script Logic Breakdown

1. Header and Styling Setup

Defines ANSI escape codes for color formatting.

Clears screen and prints stylized ASCII header.


RED='\033[0;31m'
CYAN='\033[0;36m'
echo -e "${CYAN}${BOLD}"
echo "‚ïî‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê ... ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïó"
...


---

2. Check for tmux Installation

if ! command -v tmux &>/dev/null; then
    echo -e "${RED}Error: tmux not installed${RESET}"
    exit 1
fi


---

3. Get Active Sessions

Uses tmux list-sessions with format #S (session name only), parsed into an indexed array.

mapfile -t sessions < <(tmux list-sessions -F "#S" 2>/dev/null)


---

4. Display Menu Options

Enumerates all sessions with numeric selection and adds key options:

1, 2, 3, etc. to attach to a session

n to create a new session

c followed by number to close a session

q to quit


Example:

[1] dev
[2] logs
[n] New Session
[c] Close Session (press then session number)
[q] Quit


---

5. New Session Handling

If user presses n, prompt for session name and create new tmux session:

read -p "Enter new session name: " name
if [ -n "$name" ]; then
  tmux new-session -s "$name"
fi


---

6. Close Session Handling

If user presses c, prompt for session number to close:

read -p "Session number to close: " num
session_to_kill="${sessions[$((num-1))]}"
tmux kill-session -t "$session_to_kill"


---

7. Attach to Session

On number key press, validate index and attach:

tmux attach-session -t "${sessions[$index]}"
